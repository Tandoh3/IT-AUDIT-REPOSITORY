## 📌 Why This Repository Was Created

The IT audit function continues to evolve as organizations adopt new technologies, increase digital footprints, and face stricter regulatory expectations. Auditors need:

* A **standardized** and **repeatable** audit approach
* A **central repository** of templates, scripts, checklists, and regulatory mappings
* **Alignment with global frameworks** (ITAF, COBIT-5, ISO, CIS) and local regulations (BoG Cybersecurity Directive, Data Protection Act, Payment Systems Act)

This repository helps auditors perform efficient, risk-focused, and compliant audits by providing everything needed in one place.
